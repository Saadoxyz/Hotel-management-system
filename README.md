## üåê Project Overview

This network simulates a **multi-branch hotel management system** with secure communications between managers and directors, reliable infrastructure for 60+ employees, hosted services (email, web, FTP), and smart IoT device integration.

---

## üèóÔ∏è Hotel Network Architecture

### üè¢ Hotel Branches (x3)
Each branch contains:
- Local staff PCs
- IoT devices (e.g., smart doors, thermostats)
- A managed switch and DHCP relay
- Internet access via router

### üéØ Central HQ
- Director & Manager VLANs
- Centralized Web, Email, FTP, DNS, and DHCP servers
- Inter-VLAN routing between Manager ‚Üî Director
- ACLs for controlled access

---

## üîß Technical Configuration

| Feature                | Description                                                                 |
|------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| üü™ **VLANs**           | Separate VLANs for Manager, Director, Workers, IoT, and Guests              |
| üîÄ **Inter-VLAN Routing** | Router-on-a-stick setup using sub-interfaces for manager ‚Üî director          |
| üß† **DHCP Server**     | Dynamic IPs assigned to all VLANs with helper addresses                     |
| üß≠ **DNS Server**      | Resolves `hotel.local`, `ftp.hotel.local`, `mail.hotel.local`               |
| üåê **Web Server**      | Hosts a responsive hotel website accessible to all clients                  |
| üìß **Email Server**    | Internal email exchange among the 60 staff members                          |
| üìÅ **FTP Server**      | Used to share hotel policy documents, staff files                           |
| üì° **IoT Devices**     | Smart devices simulate real-time data collection                            |
| üîê **ACL Rules**       | - Guests can‚Äôt access internal services  
                           - Only Directors can access sensitive files  
                           - Workers limited to Web + Email |

---

## üí° VLAN Assignment

| Department        | VLAN ID | Devices           |
|------------------|---------|-------------------|
| Director         | 10      | 3 PCs (HQ Only)   |
| Manager          | 20      | 3 PCs (Per Branch)|
| Staff (Workers)  | 30      | 60 PCs            |
| IoT Devices      | 40      | Smart Sensors     |
| Guest            | 50      | Laptops / Mobile  |

---

## üß™ Testing & Verification

You can test the network using the following:

```bash
# On any PC
ping 192.168.x.x
tracert mail.hotel.local
ipconfig /all

# On router
show ip interface brief
show ip route
show access-lists

# On FTP client
ftp ftp.hotel.local
````

‚úÖ Try sending emails between workers
‚úÖ Access hotel website using internal DNS
‚úÖ Test inter-VLAN routing between Director and Manager
‚úÖ Verify IoT sensors pushing simulated data
‚úÖ Check FTP upload/download permission

---

## üìÇ Tools & Requirements

* **Cisco Packet Tracer 8.x or higher**
* Layer 2 and Layer 3 switches
* 3 branch routers
* 1 centralized HQ router and servers

## üß† Pro Tip

> ‚ÄúIn this project, VLANs ensure secure segmentation between roles like managers, directors, and staff. The DHCP and DNS automate IP resolution, while IoT and Web services simulate a real hotel‚Äôs infrastructure. ACLs act like firewalls to limit who can access what.‚Äù
